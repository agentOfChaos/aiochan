CSP stands for *Communicating Sequential Processes*. The name CSP first appears in a paper by C.A.R. Hoare in 1978, and some ideas of CSP exist even before that. So CSP is actually quite an old idea."

    "Let's begin with the last word: *processes*. It seems we have immediately hit upon opportunities for great confusion: python has many packages that have \"process\" on their names, your operating system has something called \"processes\" or maybe not, depending on what OS you are using, etc. And they are not what we want to talk about now. *Process* is, unfortunately, one of thoses words in computing that is over-used in many subtly different ways. Here we shall be intentially vague: for us, a *process* is just a group of code that executes fairly independently from the outside world, a group of code that you can mentally think of as a whole entity. The quintessential example is that of a function: a function as a process goes from taking in arguments from the caller, and ends when returning to the caller."

In python this is fairly accurate, if special provision is made for control statements such as `while`, `for` and stuff. A better word might be *deterministic*: even in the presence of control statements, if you know all your variables, it is possible to predict precisely what the next statement or expression to be executed or evaluated is. An example is"

So programs without IO is pretty useless. And using global variables in this case is rather convenient: we just take something (input) that is put inside predetermined boxes (global variables), and when we are done, just put them back. Others, by inspecting the boxes, will know what we have done. By the way, at the lowest level, this is how our current computer architecture dictates. A \"pure\" function that \"returns\" something without reference to a box location *is* an illusion.

A classical example is that you and your friend both want to operate on two boxes A and B. You go forward and put your sticker on A, meanwhile your friend has already put his sticker on B. Now both of you are stuck: unless one of you back off, no one can go forward.

For example, you and your friend both want a book. Instead of putting the book in a box so that both of you can do whatever you want with it whenever you want (and risking the book to be stolen), you just take the book away and do your processing with it. After you are satisfied, you and your friend *meet together* and you *hand off* the book to your friend. Once your friend has the book, she can do anything she wants with it, while you can no longer do anything with it at all. There is no longer any stepping over. If you *really* want your book again, you must arange with your friend for a hand-off again."

    "Such an arrangment is at least familiar (it is how private properties work). Note that it is principally different from putting stickers on boxes: you just take the book and go off! And the amazing thing is, this arrangement actually solves the majority of concurrency problems. To each *sequential process*, things look as if we are in a non-concurrent program: the only concurrent parts are when we want to do IO, we arrange for rendezvous points. No stickers. No locks. Much less opportunities for deadlocks."

    "Another very important benefit of communicating over rendezvous points is the respect of privacy, or abstraction barriers. Consider the box-book example again. If we want to use stickers to solve that problem successfully, you and your friend both have to agree on a strategy (for example always start with box A), in other words, you are both opening yourselves up to each other, letting the other know things about how *you* operate, which you may be reluctant to due to various reasons. By contrast, we will find that when using rendezvous points to communicate, often the only thing the other parties need to know is the existence of the rendezvous points. The abstraction barrier is respected!"
