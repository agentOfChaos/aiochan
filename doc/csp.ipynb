    "Let's begin with the last word: *processes*. Immediately, we have encountered an opportunity for great confusion: there are simply too many things in computing that are called \"processes\" at different times, by different people, and meaning subtly different things. Without dwelling on dictionary definitions, let's agree that in this section, a *process* just means a group of computer code that executes fairly independently from other codes and from the outside world, or, a group of code that you can mentally think of as a whole entity. The quintessential example is that of a function: a function as a process goes from taking in arguments from the caller, and ends when returning to the caller. A better word might be \"task\" here, but let's just stick with the original wording."

    "So for us, a *process* is something that is logically like a function, for now. What is a *sequential* process, then? If you read the word literally, it means that statements or expressions in your function are executed or evaluated in strict order, from top to bottom. Now this is also problematic: we have so-called control statements like `while`, `for`, etc., which are useful *because* they disrupt the sequential flow of your function. However, when your program is running, and all variables and arguments have concrete values, it is true that your statements in a function are executed one by one, in some *deterministic* order as specified by the control statements in the function. *Deterministic* is the keyword here: it is possible to *predict* what happens next by knowing the current state. In this section, we will use the word *sequential* in this sense: deterministically equivalent to sequential execution."

The reason that they reach for global variables is most often the need for input/output, or IO (note that the concept of IO is much broader than file or network accesses). We need to get stuff into our process to compute, and we need to notify other processes who are also computing what our results are."

    "Indeed, IO is the whole point of computation: *we*, at our keyboards (or touch screens, or whatever your newest VR/AR interaction devices), input something for the computer to compute, the the computer returns the results to *us*. Programs without IO are pretty useless. Using global variables for IO is also rather convenient: we just take something (input) from predetermined boxes (or memory addresses), and when we are done, just put the result into some other predetermined boxes. Other processes, by inspecting the boxes, will know what we have done. At the lowest level, this is actually what our current computer architecture dictates. A \"pure\" function that \"returns\" something without reference to an address *is* an illusion.

Suppose you and your friend both want to operate on two boxes A and B. You go forward and put your sticker on A, meanwhile your friend has already put his sticker on B. Now both of you are stuck: unless one of you back off, no one can go forward. Preventing such *deadlocks* means having a whole lot of disciplines and guidelines to follow --- more training to become professional jugglers!"

Instead of putting the book in a box so that both of you can do whatever you want with it whenever you want (and risking the book to be stolen), you just take the book away and do your processing with it. After you are satisfied, you and your friend *meet together* and you *hand off* the book to your friend. Once your friend has the book, she can do anything she wants with it, while you can no longer do anything with it at all. There is no longer any stepping over. If you *really* want your book again, you must arange with your friend for a hand-off again."

What we mean is that it is of course possible to have a deadlock in CSP, by for example waiting on a rendezvous that no one else would complete. However, such situations are rather obvious, and if they ever occur in your programs, they are very easy to spot. This is unlike working with locks where you need to be careful on every step. What this means is that CSP is on a much higher level of abstraction than locks and synchronizations. It is no coincidence that working with locks very often feels like doing pointer arithmetics."

Consider the box-book example again. If we want to use stickers to solve it, you and your friend both have to agree on a strategy, for example, always start with box A. Now you are both opening yourselves up to each other, letting the other know things about how *you* operate, which you may be reluctant to with someone you just met. By contrast, when using rendezvous for communication, the existence of rendezvous and whether you intend to use it for reading or writing is often sufficient for correct execution.
