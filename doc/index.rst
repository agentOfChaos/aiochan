Welcome to aiochan's documentation!
===================================

Hello! We are excited to bring you what we consider the best concurrency control library available for Python.

You can start learning how to use aiochan now by following our tutorial, or, if you are already experienced in
Golang or Clojure's core.async, we have a ten-minutes introduction for you that can help you get to speed immediately.

We hope you find that aiochan can boost your productivity greatly, as we do, and happy coding!
